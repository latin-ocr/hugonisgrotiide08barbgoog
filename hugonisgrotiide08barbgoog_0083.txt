nullis tamen locis ejus quod utile est feci mentionem, sed

g 58 Injuriam mihi iacietsi quis me ad ullas nostri seculi
controversias, aut natas, sut qnae nascitura praevideri pos-
sunt, respexisse arbitratur. Vere enim profiteor, sicut ma
thematici figures a corporibus semotas considerant, its me in
jure tractando ab omni singulari facto abduxisse nmmum.

59 Dicendi genus quod attinet, nolui adrerum metan-

Μ darum multitudinem adjungendo verborum copiam fastidium

parere lectori, cujus utilitatibus consulebam. Itaque secutus
sam quantum potui concisum et docenti conveniens loquendi
genus: ut tanquam in uno conspectu habeant, qui negotia

whom 1 wished to benedt. 1 therefore hare followed s concise and
didactic mode oi treatment: that they who have to manage publio
affairs, may see, st one view, the kinds oi controversies which aro
went ιο ariae, and the principles by which they are ιο be deoidedr

despaired of imitating the grace in s hetin translatione such a trans-
letion 1 have however added in every instance, for the benedt of those
who find the Greek difficule.
