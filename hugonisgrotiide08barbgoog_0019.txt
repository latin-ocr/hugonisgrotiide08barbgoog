xiv EDITOR’S PREFAOE.

remark, that there would be little use in a writer on this
subject stating, as· the Rigbts of War, Rules which never
bave been observed nor ackncwledged in any actual war
up to the present time. Killing, taking prisoners and
making capturas, besieging towns, and the like, are of the
essence of war: and these are inevitably violent and
psinsul inflictione. If st any time, the rules of such prae-
tices have been hsrsber than they now are, we may say
that such Rules were the Rights of war in barbarous and
ferociens times: bnt even in such times, those Rights
imposed a certain restraint upon the victor3 as for instance,
the Right of making the conquered slaves, prevented his
taking their lives. That such Rights are often morally wrong,
Grotius himself repeatedly urges. The term Riphts, like
the term Natural Low, of which Ι bave just spoken, may
mean, either that which is secured to men by existing
Iiules, in every society, however rude3 or that which it
ought to be thesim of the most humane and picus men to
secure by Rule, as the best condition of society. But this
latter is not an ordinasy nor convenient sense of the sub-
stantive Riphta. If we were to adopt it, we should have
a difficulty in establishing the Right of killing men stall
sor no crime; and therefore, there could be no Rights of
War.

The translation may perhaps be welcume, even to the
classical scholar, for Grotius's style is not only very con-
cise and pregnant, but also full of expressions borrowed
from the jurists and the schoolmen. But as the text will
sufficiently explain these, I bave not thought it necessary
to translate the Notes, which besides, for the most part,
referto tbc quotations only. ⁴

Tbere have already been published at least three trans-
lations of Grotius's work in English, besides a small and
worthless abridgement‚ published in 1654 by G. B. (i. e.
