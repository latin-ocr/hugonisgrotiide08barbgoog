Gar. 111.] SUMMI IMPERII EXPLIGATIO. 103

responderi potest, Christi laeta omnia quidem virtutis esse
plena, et quae, quoad ejus fieri potest, imitari laudabile sit, οι
suo praemio non cariturum3 non tamen omnia ejusmodi esse,
ut aut cx lege veniant, aut legem faciant. Nam quod Christus
pro Inimicis atque impiis est mortuus, id non fecit cx lega

' aliqua, sed ex speciali quasi pacto οι foedere inito cum Patre;
quisi id faceret, non modo summam ci gloriam, sed οι gen·
tem in aternum duraturam promisit, Esaiae liii 10. Alioqui
essehoc lactum quasi singulare, ct cui rix quicquam reperia-
tur simile, ostendit Paulus Rom. v. 7. Ει Christus nos ani-
mam nostram periculis objicere jubet, non pro quibusvis, scd
pro ejusdcm disciplinas consortibus, 1 J can. iii. 16.

tentiae, partim ridentur consilium magis, et sublimis propositi

8 With rsgard to the example or* christ, who ia alleged ιο hare died
ior his cnemics, it may be answered that all tha acts oi Ohrist are full
ol virtue, and such as may be laudably imitated, as far as la possible,
and will not fail of their reward3 but they are not all such aa procced
from a law, or make alass lor us. For that Christ died for his enemics
aud for the ungodly‚ was what he did not in pursuancs of any law, but
from a special coveuant with his Father3 who promised, on that con·
ditiora, not only eternsl glory, but also aa andless offspring, Isaiah liii.
10. And so Paul describes this as a special and exceptional and
unparalleled act, Rom. r. 7: Smrcelysor ο οἰοιιοοοο mcc will cac dia
