Hobbes, found law end morality on the mutual fesr of men,
and from those who proclaim utility as the basis of their
system but also from later and celebrated dissertators
upon Natural Law, such as Ksnt and Fichte, and other
German philosophers. A recent writer* on this subject
has justly remarked this distinction: that Grotius does
not, cs those philosophers do, seek the ground and basis
of Rights in the insulated existence of the individual, but
in the sociel relations of men. The critic remarks, also,
that we do not find in him that strenuous attempt to sepa·
rate jural from morel doctrines, which, in the Kandan
period, was regarded as the essentia] condition for the
proper development of jural philosophy: nor, again, do we
meet in Grotius with that perpetual hammering upon the
innate freedom of the Person as such; with the assump-
tion that the Person, in virtue of his mere existence as a
Person, is the bearer and possessores an indefinite mass
of Rights, all which moy be asserted by force; while yet,
on the other hand, the Person may, in cases of necessity,
have to acquiesce in the mere possibility of acquiring
Right, as the sole result of his Personality. And hence,
as the writer just quoted further remarks, we do not
lind in him the harsh sud startling propositione which
occur so frequently in the jural speculatione of the Kantian
period.
