whose Principiorum rure libri quinque appeared in 1615,
130 years before the publication of the work of Grotius.
But I see no reason to think that these works did more
to anticipate the work of Grotius than the works which he
himself enumeratos and criticizea, as bearing upon the
subject3 especially the work of the Oxford Professor of

Law, Albericus Gentilis, De Jnre Belli, 11300νὶ33, 1598.

from any necessity of replying to this criticism, by the
admirable manner in which the task has already been per-
formed by Mr Hailam. That judicibus and temperate
writer finds himself compelled to refer to Mr Stewart's
attack in these terma: ‘⁸ That he should have spoken of a
work so distinguished by fame, and 30 effective, as he
