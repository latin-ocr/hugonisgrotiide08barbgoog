negari, quando illam functionem dicit a Deo institutam ctiam
pro illo tempore, ac propterea honorandam etiam intra animi
recessus, quibus proprie solus Deus imperat. Potuit ergo
et Nero, et rex ille Agrippa, quem ad Christi religionem
amplectendam Paulus tam serio invitat, Act xxvi. Christo se
subjicere, et retinere hic regiam, ille imperatoriam potes·
tatem: que sine jure gladii et armorum intelligi nequit Sicut
ergo clim pia erant sacrificia secundum legem, quamuis ab
impiis sacerdotibus celebrata3 sic pia res estimperinm, quam-
vis ab impio teneatur.

5 Tertium argumentum petitur ex Joaunis Baptistae
verbis, qui serio interrogetusa militibus J udscrs (cujus gentis
multa millia Romanis militasse ex J osepho et aliis scriptoribus
manifestissimum est) quid haberent faciendum, ut iram Dei
effugerent3 uon ecs mditia abire jussit, quod iacere debebat
si ea erat Dei voluntas, sed abstinere concussionibus et salla-
ciis, stipendiisque esse contentos, Luc.''n1. 14. Ad hec Bap-
tistae rerba, cum apertam satis militiae approbationem con·
tineent, multi respondent, que Baptista prescripsit ita discre-

iu noris excerptis, Capitoline. [Vide 111. iasa, Diss.w111.510,pag. ces, ci seqq.

cf Cyprus, htdbecomea Christian· not tc mention theancieut story
concerning the king οι Edessa, perhaps distorted, but yet with a foun-
dation oi truth*.

But· ιι the next place, the question ιι ιιι whether the persons were·
impions, but whether their office was impious; which the Apostle
denies, when he says that eren at that time it was ordained of (iod,
and therefore was to be honoured from the heart, which is God's
peculiar dominico. And thus Naro and king Agrippa might have
submitted themselves to Christ, aud have retained respectively the
imperial and the royal power; which could not herc subsisted without
the power of the sword and of arms. And thus as under the Old Lair,
munifices wcre picus, though celebrated by impious priests, so goram⁴
mant is a picus office, though it be held by au impious man.

t (3) Τιι third argumentis taken hom the words of John the
Baptista who, when he was ashed by the Jewish acidiora, (οι which
natlou there were many theuseuds iu the Roman army, ιι is manifest
from Josephus aud other writers) What they should do, to avoid the
wrath οι (iod3 did not teli them tc cease to be soldiers, which he
ought to have done ii such were the will oi (iodt but told them to
abstaiu from entenich, and to be content with their weges.
