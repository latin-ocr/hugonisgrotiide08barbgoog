Sic ante Heraclidarum imperium apud Lacones Eurotoe sucees-
sit Sparte filia, aut ejus liberi, ut Tyndareo Helenae liberi,
quia mares filii non extabant3 et Eurystheo in Mycenarum
imperium successit Atreus ejus avunculus, notante Thucydide.
Eodem jure regnum Athenarum ¹¹ad Creusam, Thebanum ⁴ad
Antigonem pervenisse notatur, quod mares deficerent. Et reg-
num Argolicum ad Argum Phoronei iex filia nepotem.

2 Unde et illud intelligere datur, quanquam liberi non-
nullis gradibus parentum praemortuorum vicem impleant, id
tamen duntaxat intelligendum, ut capaces sint juxta ceteros,
salva tamen sexus primum, deinde aetatis praerogativa inter
capaces. Nam qualitas et sexus, et matis, quatenus in hac
re a populo consideratur, ita personae adhaeret ut avelli inde
nequeat.

XIX. Quaeritur an regnum, ubi hunc in modum defertur,
pars sit hereditatis. Et verius est esse khereditatem quandam,
sed separatam ab aliorum bonorum hereditate, qualis hereditas

Eurystheus was succeeded by his uncle Atreus. By the same right the
kingdom of Athens passed to Creusa, that of Thebes to Antigone,
because the males failed= and the kingdom of Argos went to Argus
the grandson of Phoroneus through his daughter.

2 Whence it is to be understood that although children in some
degrees fill the place of parents who have died, that is to be under·-
stood, so as that they are capable of ruling compared with others, and
saving the prerogative, first of sex, and then of age. For the quality
of sex and of age, so far aa in this matter they are considered by
the people, adheres to the person, so that it cannot be separated
from it.

XIX. It is made a question whether a kingdom, when thus trans-
iia-rred, is a part of the inheritance. And the more true opinion is that
it is a certain kind of inheritauee‚ but distinct from the inheritance of
other property3 such an inheritance aa is seen in some fiefs, in leases,
iu the right of patronage, in priority of legacy. Whence it follows
that the kingdom pertains to him who may take the property as heir
if he choose to do so ς but in such a way that it maybe taken without
tho property and its burthens. The reason is, because the people is
