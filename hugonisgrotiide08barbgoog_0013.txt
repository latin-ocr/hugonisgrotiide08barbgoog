η had not been prominently put forwerda in that period, as it

was soon afterwards by Hobbes; and Grotius, in debating
the question, is driven to seck the opponente of his wider
and humaner morality, in the ancient world, among the Gre-
cian sophists. But the miscrics arising from unregulsted war
ἵ prcssed upon his thoughts with present and severe reality3
for the Thirty Ycars’ War had long been ravsging Europe.
To this spectacle he himself ascribes the origin of his work.
Hc says (Prolep. Art. 28), “I saw prevailing throughout
the Christian world a huense in making war, of which even
barharous natione would have been ashamed; recourse
was had to arms for slight reasons, or for no reason ; and
when arms were once taken up, all reverence for divine
aud human law was thrown away3 just as if men were
thenceforth authorizcd to commit all crimes without re·
straint.” The sight of these atrocities had led many men,
he says, tohold all war to be unlawful to Ohristians3 bnt
he, more temperately‚ thought that the remedy was to
bring it about that war itself should besubject to rulcs of
humanity and decency. And he adds, that he conceived
himself in some degree prepared for such a task by thc
practice of jurisprudence in his own country, and hoped‚
that, though unworthily ejected from that country, which
had been honoured by so many of his works, he might
still promote the scicnce by the labours of his pen.

He claims (Prohp. 30), to be the first who had reduced
Intercational Law to the form of an Art or Science. Nor
do I conceive that this claim goes beyond his due: thoughI
am aware that certain writers have been recently brought to
light and pointed out as his “ Precursors·.’' The Prccnrsors
thus newly brought into notice are «Iohannes Oldendorp,
