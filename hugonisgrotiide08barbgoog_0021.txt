Rev. H. A. Holden, Fellow of Trinity college, who had
before performed the same valuable service for the recent

The Notes of Gronovius, which occupy a considerable
portion of the page ol the most common editions of Gro-
tius, are in reality of very little value. It is doubted by
Tydman‚ a more recent editor, (Utrecht, 1773) whether
they were intended for publication3 and they may in
general be omitted without loss. A few notices taken
from them have been retained.

As further illustrating Barbeyrac’s labours on this
work, Ihave inserted his Preface, including the passage
in which he expresses an unfavourable judgment of the
value of the Notes of Gronovius. In this preface, the
references to Barbeyrac’s own Notes are here made ac-
cording to the-mode adopted in the present edition;
namely, by means of the Arabio numerals from 1 to 93
the Notes of Grotius being marked by the letters of the

alphabet, as in the earlier editions.
