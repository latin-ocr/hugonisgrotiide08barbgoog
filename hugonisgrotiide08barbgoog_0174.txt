ob causam lssctricius atque alii cingulum pro Christo abjecisse
leguntur. Idem olim sub Diocletiano fecerant in Armenia
mille centum quatuor, quorum in martyrologiis mentio: ct in
AEgypto Menna, et Hesychius. Sic ergo et Licinii temporibus
mnlti abjecere cingulum, qnorum fuit Arsacius inter Confes-
sores nominatus, et horontius factus postea Mopsuestia Epi-
scopus. Quare his, qui semel conscientia puncti cingulum
abjecerant, reditus ad militiam sub Licinio non patebat nisi per
fidei Christianae abnegationem: qnae quia eo erat gravior, quo
prior ille actus majorem in illis legis divina cognitionem tes-
tabatur, ideo hi defectores gravius etiam puniuntur quam illi,
dequibus egerat praecedens canon, qui sine periculo uitae ant
facultatum amittendarum Christianismum abjecerant Gene-
raliter autem de omni militia interpretari canonem, quem pro-
duximus, ab omni ratione alienum est Aperte enim testatur we,
historia, his, qui sub Licinio militium abjecerant, neque Licinio ³
imperante adeam redierant, ne fidem Christianam violarent, a
Constantino damm optionem, immunesne esse a militia vellent,

mention in the Martyrologics; and by Manna and Hesychius in Egypt
And thus at the time of Licinius many renounced the military profes·
sion, among whom was Arsacias, who is named among the Confessors,
andAnxentius, who was afterwems bishop cf Mopsuesta. And thus
those who, pricked by conscience, had once left the milituy profession,
could not return to it under Licinius, except hy renouncing the saith
of Christ3 and this transgression was the more grievous, inssmuch as

· their former act shewed that they had knowledge of the divine lew;
vherefcre those defanlters are punished cren more severely than they
who are mentioned in the preceding Canon, who, without danger to
their life or fortune, had renounced Christianity. But ιο interpret the
Cenon which we have quoted es referring ιο a military life in general,
is contrary ιο common reason. For history clearly testifica that those
who under Licinius had renounced military life and had not returned
tc it under Licinius, in order that they might not violate the Christian
faith, had the option given them hy Constantine, whether they would
he excused military service or enter the army3 and no doubt many of
them did the letter.
