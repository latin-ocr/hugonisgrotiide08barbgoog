himself admits, over the public mind of Europe, iu terms
of unmingled depreciation‚ without having done more
than glanced at some of its peges, is an extraordinary
symptom of that tendency towards prejudices, hasty but
inveterate, of which that eminent man seems to have beeu
not a little susceptible. Τὴο attack made by Stewart on
those who have taken the law of nature and natione for
their theme, and especially on Grotius, who stands for-
wards in that list,· is protracted for several peges, and it
would be tedicus to examine every sentence in succession.
Were I to do so, it is not, in my opinion, an exaggeration
to say that almost every successive sentence would lie
open to criticism.'’ He then goes on to take the chief
heads of accusation; and to his instructive discussion of
them, I refer my reader*.

Paley also, in the Preface to his Moral Philosophy,
censures Grotius for the profusion of his classical quotc-
tions; an objection of which I have already spoken, and
which Ι have here tried to remedy; and for the forensic
cast of his writings. Thetin the work of Grotius we see
everywhere traces of the juristical training of his mind, is
not to be denied; but it may be much doubted whether
this is a disadvantege 3-whether this legal discipline of
the intellect have not given a precision to his divisione
and reasonings which they would not have had without
the habits so formed. Certainly a jurist would find, in
Paley himself, great reason to complain that questions of
morality and of law are mingled together in a very con·
sused and arbitrary manner.

It was not the intention of Grotius to furnish a System
of Ethics. But is we regard the work as to its bearing on
ethical philosophy, it will, in many respects, sustain with
advantage a compar-ison with the work of Paley. Grotius
