speculation was originally derived, proceed upon the sup·
position that there is a body of Natural Law, th Notaroe,
distinct from Instituted Law (Jcs Gentium and Jas avio),
and belonging to man by his nature I have elsewhere*
endeavoured to shew that though man nowhere exists, and
by his nature cannot exist, without Laws, there is no special
body of Laws which cau distinctively be called Natural Low,
Jwa Natura I have noted (Elementa os Morality, 1052) the
inconsistenoies into which Grotius, es well as others, is

ticudsr cases. But I have also (1053,1054) pointed out
the truths which were often expressed by means of this
distinction3 namely, that the actual Law of any commu·
nity might be worse than it is; and that it may be better.
The Jus Notum may be the mere rudimenta out of which '
the Jas Gratiam is to be fashioned3 or it may be the
losty ideal which the Jus Gentium never reaches. Both
these lines of speculation are very interesting and instruo-
tive3 and we may readily concede to the philosophioal
jurists the use of the phraseology which they have been
accustomed to employ on such questions3 and which is
often convenient and useful for these and other purposes.
Jas Gmtiam is a phrase which, about the time of Gro-
tius, was passing from its ancient Roman meaning, tle Low
common to most Notiora, to its modern meaning, tho Low
between Notiora. The prolix and multifarious character of
Grotius’s work arises, in a great measure, from his setting
out from the first of these meanings, in order to discnss
the second He thus begins with the philosophy of ethice,
and ends with exhortatione to humanity, truth, and justice,
even in the conduct of wars. The latter indeed, was more
peculiarly his object than the former3 for the narrow and
