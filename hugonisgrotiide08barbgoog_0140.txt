7 (ὁ) Ιιι the oen pisce, it cannot be shown by any argument that
the law of Moses concerning the judgments oi tribunale ceesed ιο be
in force before the city of Jerusalem was destroyed, and with it, the
existence and the hope οι the Jewish nation oeasod. For there is
neither in the lsw of Moses any term appointed for the force oi the
law, nor do Christ orbis Apostles snywhere speak οι the cusation οι
that law, except in so far as such an erent may, as we have said, be
comprehended in the destruction of the Jewhh state: on the contrary,
Paul says thot the high priest was appointed to judge persons accord·
ing to the lew, Acts xxiii. 3. Christ himself, in the proface to his pre·
cepte ssys, ιιιιιι he was not come to destroy the law, but to fulsi it,
Matth. r. li. Now in what sense thiais to be understood οι the
Ritual Law, is plain enough; for tho lineamenta which shsdow out an
'object are fuldilsd when the perfect form of the thing isexhibited.
“ Βιιι horr can this be true oi the ‚Iudicial how, ir Christ, as some hold,
took it away br his coming? But ii the obligationes the haw re·
mained as long ss the Jewish state continued, it follows that Jews,
eren though convortad to Christianity, ii they wore summoned before
s magistrate, could not retuso, and ought not to judge otherwise than
moses had commanded.
