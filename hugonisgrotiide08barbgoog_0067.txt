lxii PROLEGOMENA.

reniet expecto aut contractu, quae foderum, quae jurisjurandi Ι
tum privati, tam publici vis atque interpretatio, quidex damno
dcto debeatur, quae legatorum sanctimonie, quale jus humandi

id quod in bello linet, cum id quod impune tit autetiam apud
populos exteros pro jure defenditur ab eo quod vitio caret
distinxisset, descendit cd pecie genera, et omues bellicas con-
tentiones.

tion arises from ownemhip, what is the rule of roysl succession, what
right is obtained by pact or contrnct, what is the force and interpre-

tationes treaties, of oeths private aud public, whatis due for demago
done, what is the sacredness of ambussadors, the right of burying
the dead, and the nature of punishmeuts.

35 The Third Book has for its subject, iu the first place, what is
lewful in war; end when it has drawn a distinction between that
which is done with impunity, or may eron, in dealing with foreiguers,
be defended as consistent with Rights3 and that which is really free
from fault; it then descende ιο the kinds of Pence sud ιο doureutious
iu Wer.

36 The undertaking such a work appeared ιο me the more wor-
thy of the labour which it must cost, because, ae Ihare said, no one
has treated the whole of the argument; and those who have treated
perte thereos, here so treated them that they hare left much ιο the
industry of others. 0f the old philosophers nothing is extant of this
kind, neither oi the Greeks, among whom Aristotle is said to hare
written a book called the Laws of War*, nor of those (the Fcthers)
who wrote au Christiane iu the early period of the Ohureh3 which
is much to be regretted3 and eren of the books of the ancient
Romans concerning the Law recognized by their Feciales, or Heraldr'
Collepe, we have received nothing but the neme. [See oe. Off. i. 113
