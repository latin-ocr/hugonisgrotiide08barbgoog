tion in the Laws of Nations, it has, in that department
also, been always regarded aa a primary work. It soon
gave rise to Puffendorfs Treatise On tlte Laws of Nature
aad Notiora, and to other books of the same kind; of
which some, like our own Rutherforth’s Ouarsa os Lecturus

it nothing but the name. Mackintosh, in more than one
place, gives to the work the highest terms of his eloquent
praise3 and how Mr Heliam speaks of it has been men·

Several objections have, however, been made to the
work ; and among them, one which I shall especially notice,
since an attempt is made in the present edition to remedy

that Grotius’s composition is so encumbered, in almost
every page, with a multitude of quotations from ancient

I am notat all disposed to dissent from what several
eminent men have said in answer to this; defending Gro-
tius's quotations, as evidences of men’s moral jndgments,

phioal work. Hence, in the translation with which I have
accompanied the text, I have omitted all the quotations
except those which were necessary to carry on the argu·

reduced more than one halt3 while, the names of the
authors quoted, being retained in the translation, the
render can, if he chooses, pass to the passages adduced,
which he will lind on the same page. The translationis
thus rather a seleotive than an abridged translation3 for
the didactic and argumentative parts are, in general, so
