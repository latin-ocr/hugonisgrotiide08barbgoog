sions and clauses are introduced in a great number oi
passages where they seemed likely to make the meaning

It appears to mathat the scheme and reasoning of
Grotius's work are well worthy of being thus carefully
presented to the reader. I agree with a former editor,
Barbeyrac‚ that Grotius’s learning, wonderful as it was,
